            User can register to the application and their login data are save in PostgreSQL. User authentication is
            provided by Spring Security. After log in the application user can create his curriculum vitae by filling
            the create CV form. Data from the form are persisted in XML files by user's name. Afterwards the user can
            edit his CV anytime. XML changes are managed as DOM. The user has the possibility to download his CV as pdf.
            Before download, the XML file is transformed to a LaTeX document with special template and the pdf document
            is generated. Pdf document is then send to the user as stream of bites. The frontend of the application
            is implemented using JSP. The frontend provides for the user the possibility to switch between many
            languages of the main elements of his CV.
